**Introduction**

**Dataset Description**

The Titanic dataset gives insight into the Titanic shipwreck and the survival rate of passengers with respect to Pclass, Sex, Age, Fare, Embarkation port and family. This dataset comprises 1309 data points (rows) and 13 informative columns, namely; ‘PassengerId’, ‘Survived’, ‘Pclass’, ‘Name’, ‘Sex’, ‘Age’, ‘SibSp’, ‘Parch’, ‘Ticket’, ‘Fare’, ‘Cabin’, ‘Embarked’ and ‘Family’.                                                                 
In this analysis, ‘PassengerId’ and ‘Ticket’ are dropped because they are not necessary for the analysis.                                                                                                                     
Also, ‘Cabin’ is dropped because it contains too many null values. In the Embarked column, S denotes for Southampton, C stands for Cherbourg and Q stands for Queenstown.

**Conclusions**

In summary, this dataset gives insights into the impact of Pclass, Sex, Age, Fare and Embarkation port on the survival rate of passengers on the ship. It shows that older people used first class and they paid more fare and they also survived more. It also shows that females survived more than the males. The above outcome could be because the older people earn more salary which made them use first class and also because the older people and females were given preference during the rescue mission.
These findings can guide potential sea travelers on the class to use when travelling and also educate rescue teams on the need for sufficient life boats to take along for rescue missions so that some people are not given preferential treatments while others are left to die.
